      Hello I am Kayleigh Bond, I am a senior this year. I really enjoy playing
      softball. I have 2 dogs, one Siberian Husky and a Cocker Spaniel. I will be
      18 on August 30,2020. I spent all quarantine playing Ark Survival Evolved
      on my Xbox. Sometimes I work on a ranch, and help take care of the horses.
      I drive and or ride on the four-wheelers, side by sides, the horses, and
      the tractor on the ranch. I really like the Logic class I am in at Area 30,
      and plan to use what I learn there in the future.

    <h2><u>Three Favorite Things</u></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dogs - I personally own a Siberian Husky, her name is Lucky and
          She is red and white. We also have another husky whom is my fathers
          and she is 13 or 14 years old in human years, she is balck and white
          and her name is Tinkerbell. Then there is the Cocker Spaniel, he is
          brown and white and his name is Ace. At my mother's house we have a
          Pomeranian is a golden brown color and his name is Gizmo.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Softball - I have played for about 3 years, My first year I ended
          up in the hospital due to being in chronic pain everywhere. My
          second year I broke my ankle during our second game sliding into
          home plate. My third year went fantastic and i caught every single
          game and we won the championship. I went on to play fall ball and had
          gotten hit in the ankle I had broke the year before. I ended up having
          bone contusions, which are basically cracks in your bone that fill with
          blood. Which made it impossible for me to be able to finish that season
          playing with my team. I was fully recovered in time for high school
          softball. I worked my butt off everyday to improve and do well, but due
          to Covid-19 it was cancelled.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Ark Survival Evolved - I spent my entire quarantine playing this game,
          I made a lot of great friends and met a lot of funny and cool people.
          I really enjoy the pvp, building, and taming of dinosaurs aspect. I was
          lucky to sleep more than 2 hours a day due to the grind. If you want to
          do well you have to be on practically 24/7 improving your base and
          dinosaurs stats. But after hardly sleeping for about 5 months, I decided
          to quit and try and get my life back on track and in order. Which was
          believe it or not a really difficult choice to make, I did not want to
          just throw away what I had put so much time and hard work into.</li>
